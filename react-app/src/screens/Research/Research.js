                        <p>As a research project, we use both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how academic pathways are shaped by its surrounding information ecosystem. Specifically, we study trends and patterns in search and exploration behaviors with data gathered through Pathways. We also investigate ways to develop algorithmic recommendations and psychological interventions that can better facilitate interest exploration and purpose development through academic journeys.</p>

                        Students who use Pathways enable our research. The knowledge we gain through Pathways is available to inform studentsâ€™ decisions, teaching, and administration at Cornell, and the accumulation of scientific knowledge about choice and decision generally.

                        We collect information regarding user interactions with Pathways and analyze data at the aggregate level only. In the interest of research, users may also be exposed to survey questions and variations in the presentation of information in Pathways. The data we gathered through Pathways is deidentified and studied by linking it with other information about Cornell students collected through the University systems.
